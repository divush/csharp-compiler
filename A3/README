C# Grammar Specification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/aa664812(v=vs.71).aspx
We have done some modifications in the grammar to resolve conflicts and to simplify the 
implementation.

Description of Component Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
parser.py > Parser for language to be compiled. It uses PLY and hence yacc implementation.
lexer.py > Lexer for language to be compiled. It uses PLY and hence lex implementation.
parser > Shell script to parse given test file and generate html output via html.cpp.
html.cpp > Code for generating html output. Invoked by parser shell script.

Commands to be executed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd asgn3/
$ make
$ bin/parser test/test1.cs

Note : The last command also opens the html file in the default web browser.

Description of intermediate files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output.txt > Stores the yacc output.
for_tree.txt > Stores the reduction rules used by the parser (extracted from output.txt).
parser.txt > Stores the reverse of parser.txt. Essentially gives rightmost derivations in order.
out.txt > Stores sentential forms for each step in the derivation.

Output files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
right_derivation.html > The html file that contains the derivation represented by sentential forms with colour for the non-terminal being expanded in the next step.

Implementation Details
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have tried to include most of the feature of the C# language in this version of the parser. However, to avoid grammar conflicts and simplify the implementation, we had to leave out some of the features of the language. As of now, following features of the C# Language are NOT implemented in the parser. These features might be included in the future versions.

1.	Query related rules
2.	From, Where clauses
3.	Orderings
4.	Attributes
5.	Extern Alias Directives
6.	Positional Arguments
7.	Anonymous Function Parameter Modifiers (REF/OUT)
8.	Yeild Statements
9.	Qualified Alias Member
10.	Interfaces
11.	Variance Annotation
12.	Constraints
13.	Null Coalescing Expression
14.	Null Assignments
15.	Indexers
16.	Events
17.	Properties
